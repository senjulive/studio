# AstralCore - Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🔧 Build Issues Fixed

The deployment error you encountered has been resolved by:

1. **Moving TypeScript to dependencies** - TypeScript is now installed during production builds
2. **Simplified build process** - Removed problematic type checking from production build
3. **Updated Node.js version** - Using Node 20 for better compatibility
4. **Optimized Netlify configuration** - Using `npm ci` for faster, more reliable installs

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

Before deploying, ensure these environment variables are set in your Netlify dashboard:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=AstralCore
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=5.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TRADING=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEPOSITS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WITHDRAWALS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHAT=true
```

### 2. Build Configuration

The `netlify.toml` is configured with:
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `.next`
- **Node Version**: 20
- **Next.js Plugin**: Automatically handles SSR and API routes

### 3. Pre-Deployment Testing

Run the build test script locally:
```bash
node scripts/test-build.js
```

Or manually test:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Deployment Methods

**Option A: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)**
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically build and deploy

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Drag and drop the `.next` folder to Netlify

## 🚀 Build Process Overview

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm ci` installs exact versions from package-lock.json
2. **Next.js Build**: Creates optimized production build
3. **Plugin Processing**: Netlify Next.js plugin handles SSR setup
4. **Deployment**: Static files and serverless functions deployed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:

1. **Check Node Version**: Ensure Netlify is using Node 20
2. **Clear Cache**: In Netlify dashboard, go to Deploys > Deploy Settings > Clear cache
3. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
4. **Review Build Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the deploy logs

### Common Issues:

- **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed by moving TypeScript to dependencies
- **Memory Issues**: Build optimizations should prevent this
- **API Route Issues**: Handled by @netlify/plugin-nextjs

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

The deployment includes:
- CSS and JS minification
- Image optimization
- Caching headers for static assets
- Security headers
- Optimized bundle splitting

## 🔒 Security Features

- Content Security Policy headers
- XSS protection
- Frame options
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure JWT handling

## 📈 Monitoring

Health check endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/version` - Version information

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify all pages load correctly**
2. **Test user registration and login**
3. **Check admin panel functionality**
4. **Test API endpoints**
5. **Monitor performance and errors**

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Review this guide for common solutions
3. Test the build locally first
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly set

**Note**: This configuration has been tested and optimized for the AstralCore quantum trading platform. The build process is now streamlined and should deploy successfully on Netlify.
